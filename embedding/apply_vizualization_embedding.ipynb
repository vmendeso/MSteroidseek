M–28 (loss of C₂H₄ or CO) could indicate either an ethylene elimination or CO loss from an acylium ion – context with other peaks will clarify.

Below is a step-by-step strategy, applied especially to steroid spectra: Step 1: Identify the Molecular Ion (M⁺·) – Look at the highest m/z values in the spectrum. If a peak stands out near the expected molecular weight (based on formula or known MW), that is likely M⁺·. Confirm by isotopic pattern: e.g. a C_19H_28O_2 s\n",

In EI, only cations are detected, so all significant peaks represent positively charged fragments (radical cations or protonated neutrals in some cases).
