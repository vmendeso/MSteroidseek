ecule, it knocks out an electron, yielding an excited radical cation (M⁺·). This can undergo various fragmentation pathways before reaching a stable ionic form. Key fragmentation mechanisms include: simple bond cleavages, α-cleavage next to functional groups, rearrangements, and loss of small neutrals. Below we outline these pathways, with emphasis on those relevant to steroids and similar organics:

ng the bond adjacent (α) to that group often yields a resonance-stabilized cation. For carbonyl compounds, α-cleavage is prominent: the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the adjacent carbon breaks, yielding an acylium ion. In steroids with a 3-ketone (e.g. Δ^4-3-one structure), α-cleavage can occur at the bond between C3–C4 or C2–C3. One important result is elimination of a neutral fragment COCH$_2$ (42 Da, i.e. –CH$_2$CO– removal) from the A-ring fda.gov . This produces a fragment at [M–42]^

 es α-cleavage to yield oxonium ions; however, in steroids, –OH often instead triggers water loss (see below) more so than simple α-cleavage.
Rearrangement Reactions (McLafferty and Others) Rearrangements involve simultaneous bond breakage and atom migration, leading to even-electron fragment ions. The classic example is the McLafferty rearrangement: a molecule with a carbonyl and a gamma-hydrogen (on a carbon at least 3 atoms away) can undergo a cyclic six-membered transition state transfer o

Advanced Knowledge Base: Interpreting EI Mass Spectra of Steroids and Organic Compounds Introduction Electron Ionization (EI) mass spectrometry produces a complex "fingerprint" spectrum for organic molecules, rich in fragment ions. Interpreting these spectra requires understanding the m/z values (mass-to-charge, typically equal to molecular mass for singly-charged ions), identifying the molecular ion and base peak, and analyzing relative intensities of fragment ions. In this guide, we focus on E

Below is a step-by-step strategy, applied especially to steroid spectra: Step 1: Identify the Molecular Ion (M⁺·) – Look at the highest m/z values in the spectrum. If a peak stands out near the expected molecular weight (based on formula or known MW), that is likely M⁺·. Confirm by isotopic pattern: e.g. a C_19H_28O_2 s

In EI, only cations are detected, so all significant peaks represent positively charged fragments (radical cations or protonated neutrals in some cases). Relative Intensities and Stability: The pattern of fragment intensities reflects each ion's stability and the probability of its formation. Stable carbocation fragments (allylic, benzylic, tertiar

der those subtle differences or use additional data to distinguish them. Step 6: Leverage Spectral Libraries or Literature – In practice, one often compares the unknown's spectrum to reference spectra (NIST library, etc.) for identification. For deep understanding, however, interpreting the fragmentation as above is invaluable. Cross-check your assignments with known spectra from reliable sources: e.g., NIST WebBook entries researchgate.net , MassBank records massbank.eu massbank.eu , or literat

These ions are not unique to steroids but indicate branched alkyl fragments and can support identification of certain substructures (e.g. m/z 91 indicates an aromatic benzyl fragment, rarely relevant in natural steroids except in aromatic ring A of estrogens). High-Mass Oxidized Fragments: In specialized cases (e.g. under lower EI energy or with chemical ionization), molecular adducts or oxidized ions can appear (like cholesterol M–H with a hydrog

The 85 Da loss to give m/z 301 might be loss of C_6H_{13} (perhaps part of the side chain) indicating a fragmentation partway through the side chain. 213 is another significant ion (386–173). 173 Da might correspond to cleavage that drops part of rings C/D plus side chain. Actually, cholesterol's m/z 213 can be rationalized by cleavage of the C17–C20 bond plus some rearrangements, yielding a fragment containing rings A and B and part of ring C.

Step 5: Map Fragments to Structure – Use the deduced fragment origins to piece together the structure or confirm a proposed structure: Draw the steroid skeleton and mark where each major fragment could come from.
